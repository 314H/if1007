# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers, students, practitioners and other professors to help this course project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in Slack ([#if1007-2018-1](https://if1007-2018-1.slack.com/messages/C8U5XEN5Q/)). We want you working on things you're excited about.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to if1007-Microservices](https://github.com/vinicius3w/if1007-Microservices/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include sources, citations and as much information as possible about their contribution. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature or issue per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
Vinicius Garcia, Professor of the IF1007 at [Centro de Infrom√°tica](http://wwww.cin.ufpe.br)
